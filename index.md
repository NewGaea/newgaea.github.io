# New Gaea Network

A creative network of artists, authors, writers, developers, photographers, and more.

## Our Network

Our network is a collection of creative individuals who are passionate about their craft. We are a community coming together to share our work and help each other grow. We create our own standards, and we are not afraid to break the rules. **Find out more about our network, [here](/about.html).**

## Our Mission

Our mission is to support our member creatives in their creative processes by providing support as a close-knit community, including, but not limited to; creative support, administrative support, licensing support, and more. We build each other up, making sure we each value ourselves and our work. 

## Our Principles

- Inclusivity
- Respect
- Support
- Growth
- Kindness

## Note:

Some of our members are not yet ready to share their work with the public. We are working on a way to share their work with our members only. Membership of New Gaea does not mean that each member agrees with every other member or their work. We are all individuals, and we all have our own opinions. We are all here to support each other, and we are all here to grow. However, every member of New Gaea is expected to be respectful of each other and their work, and to adhere to the rules of the network and our principles.
