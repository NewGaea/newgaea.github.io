# About New Gaea

**New Gaea** is a creative network of artists, authors, writers, developers, photographers, and more. We are comprised of a handful of subsidiaries, each with their own focus and purpose. By coming together, we are able to support each other in our creative processes, and we are able to share our work with the world.

## Our Network

### New Gaea Entertainment

New Gaea Entertainment serves as the publisher and copyright holder for all content produced relating to The Shattered Verse and its related settings, including Atrusius and New Gaea.

New Gaea Entertainment does not publish adult-oriented, or “Not Safe For Work” (henceforth, NSFW), content under its own name. Nudity in any product published by New Gaea Entertainment must be either doll-like (lacking in explicit detail) or non-lewd with artistic merit, as determined by a minimum of two-thirds of the members of the Board.

Any member in good standing of the New Gaea Network may allow New Gaea Entertainment to manage the copyright of their characters and may also choose to publish their original non-adult products under the name of New Gaea Entertainment, so long as they are compliant with the legal policies of New Gaea Entertainment relating to acceptable content.

### Millenium Lily Studios

Millenium Lily Studios serves as the publisher and copyright holder for all adult-oriented, or NSFW, content relating to The Shattered Verse and its related settings, including Atrusius and New Gaea.

Any member in good standing of the New Gaea Network may also choose to publish their original adult products under the name of Millenium Lily Studios, so long as they are compliant with the legal policies of Millenium Lily Studios relating to acceptable adult content.

### Squawk

Squawk (formerly Squawk 6A02) is real-word travel blogs and accessibility reviews around travel, published with it’s own brand but as part of the NGE Identity.

*Note: From 2020 through 2022, Squawk was on hiatus as part of the Global Coronavirus Pandemic, and plans to relaunch in 2023.*

### KatCodes

KatCodes is a development studio, creating unique experiences for Roleplayers, Gamers, and more. Ranging from Mods for Minecraft Java Edition, to custom websites, to custom Discord bots, KatCodes is a one-stop-shop for all your development needs.
